# Logon-Security

Logon Security helps you with adding extra security to your windows device by forcing an extra password to be typed. Only real user knows what to do when the prompt is shown!

You can use only specific keys from your keyboard to type the password and these keys are not mapped to what letters they usually are. If the password is wrongly typed three times you need to press specific keys to unlock the application and to retry to type the password. You cannot access anything like task manager that can interfere with the scope of the application while the window is shown.

# Prerequisites

Visual Studio, QT extension for Visual Studio and any Qt version starting with 5.13

# Build

Go to Build -> Build Solution to build the application.
